This is a collection of patches I wrote / planning to write for Nheko.  
They are as follows:  

makemessagesrainbowbydefault.diff  
Makes all messages rainbow (as if you typed in `/rainbow` before every message).  
To send a 'normal' message (you boring conformer),  
prefix a message with /plain or /md respectively.
