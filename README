This is a collection of patches I wrote / am planning to write for Nheko.  
They are as follows:  

# makemessagesrainbowbydefault.diff  
Makes all messages rainbow (as if you typed in `/rainbow` before every message).  
To send a 'normal' message (you boring conformer),  
prefix a message with /plain or /md respectively.  

# ilikemyfriends,makerainbowsreadable1.diff  
Turns down the saturation from 90% to 51% (I think).  
This makes the yellows of the rainbow dirtier,  
and makes the blues less blackish.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

# ilikedarkthemes,bringpaintolightthemeusers.diff  
Makes your messages easy to read for dark themes,  
but anyone with a light theme will be perpetually squinting.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

# ideSpisEEveRYone,leTtHemsuFfEr.diff  
Makes the first half of your message's text white,  
and the second half black. No theme shall escape your wrath.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)
