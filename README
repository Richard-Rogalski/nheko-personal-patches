This is a collection of patches I wrote / am planning to write for Nheko.  
They are as follows:  

# makemessagesrainbowbydefault.diff  
Sends all your messages rainbow (as if you typed in `/rainbow` before every message).  
To send a 'normal' message (you boring conformer),  
prefix a message with /plain or /md respectively.  

# ilikemyfriends,makerainbowsreadable1.diff  
Turns down the saturation from 90% to 51% (I think).  
This makes the bright yellows of the rainbow dirtier,  
and makes the dark blues less blackish.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

# ilikedarkthemes,bringpaintolightthemeusers.diff  
Makes your messages easy to read for dark themes,  
but anyone with a light theme will be perpetually squinting.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

# ilikelightthemes,letdarkthemeusersseethe.diff  
Fellow light theme users likely won't even be able to tell something's amiss.  
Dark theme users, definitely will to say the least.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

# ideSpisEEveRYone,leTtHemsuFfEr.diff  
Makes the first half of your message's text white,  
and the second half black. No theme shall escape your wrath.  
#### (only affects `/rainbow` messages)  

These diffs/patches are in the -p1 format, as that's the Gentoo consensus on what level contextual gnu diffs should be.  
To manually apply any of these diffs/patches to Nheko, run these commands in the main Nheko directory:  
```
patch -p1 <nameofanydiffsyouwant.diff  
```
And then to build Nheko:  
```
cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  
cmake --build build  
```
Nheko will be built to `build/nheko`. Enjoy!!
